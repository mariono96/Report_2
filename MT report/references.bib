abstract = "In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised algorithm for automatically segmenting a single 3D shape or co-segmenting a family of 3D shapes using deep learning. The algorithm consists of three stages. In the first stage, we pre-decompose each 3D shape of interest into primitive patches to generate over-segmentation and compute various signatures as low-level shape features. In the second stage, high-level features are learned, in an unsupervised style, from the low-level ones based on deep learning. Finally, either segmentation or co-segmentation results can be quickly reported by patch clustering in the high-level feature space. The experimental results on the Princeton Segmentation Benchmark and the Shape COSEG Dataset exhibit superior segmentation performance of the proposed method over the previous state-of-the-art approaches."

The work reviewed in this survey stems from the following three research communities: computer graphics, computer vision and photogrammetry and remote sensing. Our goal is to provide a survey that will help researchers to better position their own work in the context of existing solutions, and to help newcomers and practitioners in computer graphics to quickly gain an overview of this vast field. Further, we would like to bring the mentioned research communities to even more interdisciplinary work, since the reconstruction problem itself is by far not solved.}

   abstract = {Favio Saponara Object recognition using the Kinect ABSTRACT The analysis of the environment is of great importance for autonomous robots because their behavior in the navigation depends on this. Depth distance from objects into the scene then represents a very useful data. As this sensor type previously existed only in very expensive devices, there is a lack of software and algorithms that exploit it comparing to the 2D space where usually a single camera is used without the information of the depth. Since the Kinect has been introduced into the market in 2010 at a really cheap price for this kind of device, a lot of research is involving this field. Inside the Robot Operating System (ROS) software the Point Cloud Library (PCL) has been integrated. On this library some state-of-the-art algorithms have been created. We will either use the ROS and the PCL library, evaluating the results and introducing some improvements and hints for future work. We will introduce also some state-of-the-art algorithms in order to apply the conversion from Computer-Aided Design (CAD) into Point Cloud Data (PCD) models which represent the format used by the PCL. },

The latest mobile mapping systems provide an efficient technique for acquiring very dense point clouds along road corridors, so that automated procedures for recognizing and extracting structures can be developed. This paper presents a framework for structure recognition from mobile laser scanned point clouds. It starts with an initial rough classification into three larger categories: ground surface, objects on ground, and objects off ground. Based on a collection of characteristics of point cloud segments like size, shape, orientation and topological relationships, the objects on ground are assigned to more detailed classes such as traffic signs, trees, building walls and barriers. Two mobile laser scanning data sets acquired by different systems are tested with the recognition methods. Performance analyses of the test results are provided to demonstrate the applicability and limits of the methods. While poles are recognized for up to 86\%, classification into further categories requires further work and integration with imagery."

abstract = "In this work we address the task of the contextual classification of an airborne LiDAR point cloud. For that purpose, we integrate a Random Forest classifier into a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework. It is a flexible approach for obtaining a reliable classification result even in complex urban scenes. In this way, we benefit from the consideration of context on the one hand and from the opportunity to use a large amount of features on the other hand. Considering the interactions in our experiments increases the overall accuracy by 2\%, though a larger improvement becomes apparent in the completeness and correctness of some of the seven classes discerned in our experiments. We compare the Random Forest approach to linear models for the computation of unary and pairwise potentials of the CRF, and investigate the relevance of different features for the LiDAR points as well as for the interaction of neighbouring points. In a second step, building objects are detected based on the classified point cloud. For that purpose, the CRF probabilities for the classes are plugged into a Markov Random Field as unary potentials, in which the pairwise potentials are based on a Potts model. The 2D binary building object masks are extracted and evaluated by the benchmark ISPRS Test Project on Urban Classification and 3D Building Reconstruction. The evaluation shows that the main buildings (larger than 50m2) can be detected very reliably with a correctness larger than 96\% and a completeness of 100\%."

abstract = {Abstract In recent times mobile laser scanning (MLS) has been used to acquire massive 3D point clouds in urban areas and along road corridors for the collection of detailed data for 3D city modelling, building façade reconstruction and capture of vegetation and road features for inventories. The objectives of this paper are the extraction of tree features from such data-sets and the modelling of trees for the purpose of visualisation in 3D city models. After the detection of high vegetation the point cloud is reduced using a 3D alpha shape approach. Then the required model parameters such as crown and stem height, crown and stem diameter, and crown shape are derived and the trees are modelled individually in a realistic manner. The tree model so generated correctly represents the overall appearance of the tree. However, the inner structure such as the branching of the tree crown is parameterised. The workflow reduces the point cloud by means of a step-by-step process, which eases the handling of the massive MLS data-sets. The thinning using 3D alpha shapes reduces the amount of data to be processed by about 95\%. It is shown that the model parameters are not influenced by the thinning procedure employed. This proves the robustness of the data reduction method and the tree modelling approach.}

abstract="3D urban maps with semantic labels and metric information are not only essential for the next generation robots such autonomous vehicles and city drones, but also help to visualize and augment local environment in mobile user applications. The machine vision challenge is to generate accurate urban maps from existing data with minimal manual annotation. In this work, we propose a novel methodology that takes GPS registered LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) point clouds and street view images as inputs and creates semantic labels for the 3D points clouds using a hybrid of rule-based parsing and learning-based labelling that combine point cloud and photometric features. The rule-based parsing boosts segmentation of simple and large structures such as street surfaces and building facades that span almost 75{\%} of the point cloud data. For more complex structures, such as cars, trees and pedestrians, we adopt boosted decision trees that exploit both structure (LiDAR) and photometric (street view) features. We provide qualitative examples of our methodology in 3D visualization where we construct parametric graphical models from labelled data and in 2D image segmentation where 3D labels are back projected to the street view images. In quantitative evaluation we report classification accuracy and computing times and compare results to competing methods with three popular databases: NAVTEQ True, Paris-Rue-Madame and TLS (terrestrial laser scanned) Velodyne.",
